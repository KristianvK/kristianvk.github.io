					<p><br>Hi!</p>
					
					<p>I'm a first-year MSc student in Data Science for Decision Making 
            at Maastricht University, in the south of the Netherlands. I have a 
            strong interest in NLP, with several courses on the topic including 
            the course of Prof. dr. ir. Jan C. Scholtes in Advanced Natural 
            Language Processing. I'm also dedicated to Recommender Systems with 
            several projects during my master's studies supervised by Dr. 
            Francesco Barile.</p>
					
					<p>I did my BSc at Maastricht University as well, in Data Science and 
            Artificial Intelligence. At the end of my first year, I was invited 
            to take part in the KE@Work Honours Programme in which I joined Visma. 
            In short, KE@Work is a business placement for the brightest and most 
            ambitious bachelor's students where students work in a company for 
            two days a week tackling Data Science/AI challenges for two years. 
            Within the Data Science team of Visma, I focus on projects for Team 
            Jumbo-Visma, particularly our Calorie Prediction project. At the end 
            of my internship, Visma offered me to stay with a part-time position 
            as a Junior Data Scientist next to my master's studies in which I 
            spend most of my time on projects for the Team Jumbo-Visma Women's 
            team.</p>

            <h3>Data Science at Visma</h3>
            <img src="TJV_paper_abstract.png" style ="border-radius:4%" align="right" width="400"/>
            <p>At Visma, I've been developing, deploying and monitoring machine 
              learning models for predicting the amount of calories required for
              a race for the benefit of Team Jumbo-Visma (ranked first on the 
              <!-- <img src="TJV_truck.jpeg" style ="border-radius:4%" align="right" width="300"/> -->
              UCI World Team Rankings and winner of the Tour de France 2022, 
              considered as the most prestigious cycling race). Until 2020, 
              Team Jumbo-Visma would start preparing their calorie estimates up to three 
               weeks in advance to ensure they had adequate estimates per 
               cyclist and per stage. This is a time-consuming task. To improve 
               the team performance, I, along with the data science team of Visma Connect, built regression models to predict the 
               calories burned by a rider without needing any human computation. The models 
              provide coaches with the calorie needs for each cyclist per race. 
              I was invited to the broadcast "Wetenschap Vandaag" (Science Today) 
              on the Dutch national radio to cover my work. A replay of the show 
              can be found below (half in Dutch, half in English).</p>
              <p>At the end of my bachelor's, I wrote my thesis <i>Conformal Regression in Calorie Prediction for
                Team Jumbo-Visma</i>, supervised by Dr. Christof Seiler. I 
                investigated conformal regression techniques to provide 
                prediction sets, quantifying the reliability of the models 
                predictions. This allows coaches to adapt predictions based on 
                the uncertainty of the forecasts. </p>
              <p>
              I also work on developing a Talent Identification Dashboard 
              for the cycling team using performance statistics, race results 
              and rider profiles. We predict relative PCS (Pro Cycling Stats) 
              points for the upcoming two seasons per specialty (ITT, climber, 
              sprinter). The model helps coaches to identify the best talents 
              at an early age.</p>
