					<p><br>Hi!</p>
					
					<p>I'm a second-year MSc student in Data Science for Decision Making 
            at Maastricht University, in the south of the Netherlands. I have a strong interest in conformal prediction and
            uncertainty quantification in machine learning.</p>
					<p>I did my BSc at Maastricht University as well, in Data Science and 
            Artificial Intelligence. At the end of my first year, I was invited 
            to take part in the KE@Work Honours Programme in which I joined Visma. 
            In short, KE@Work is a business placement for the brightest and most 
            ambitious bachelor's students where students work in a company for 
            two days a week tackling Data Science/AI challenges for two years. 
            Within the Data Science team of Visma, I focused on projects for Team 
            Jumbo-Visma (now Visma Lease a Bike), particularly our Calorie Prediction project. Currently, I'm performing an internship at ASML within the EUV Wafer Defectivity team.</p>

            <h3>Data Science at Visma <img src="visma-logo.png" alt="Icon" width="100" height="56"></h3>
            <img src="newscientist-v4.png" style ="border-radius:2%; margin-left: 10px;" align="right" width="350"/>
            <p>At Visma, I developed, deployed and monitored machine 
              learning models for predicting the amount of calories required for
              a race for the benefit of Team Jumbo-Visma (ranked first on the 
              UCI World Team Rankings 2023 and winner of the Tour de France 2023, 
              considered as the most prestigious cycling race). Until 2020, 
              Team Jumbo-Visma would start preparing their calorie estimates up to three 
               weeks in advance to ensure they had adequate estimates per 
               cyclist and per stage. This is a time-consuming task. To improve 
               the team performance, I, along with the data science team of Visma Connect, built regression models to predict the 
               calories burned by a rider without needing any human computation. The models 
              provide coaches with the calorie needs for each cyclist per race. 
              I was invited to the broadcast "Wetenschap Vandaag" (Science Today) 
              on the Dutch national radio to cover my work. A replay of the show 
              can be found below (half in Dutch, half in English). I also gave an interview on my work to New Scientist (<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2368436-ai-helps-cyclists-work-out-how-much-to-eat-during-the-tour-de-france/">link to article</a>).</p>
              <p>At the end of my bachelor's, I wrote my thesis <i>Conformal Regression in Calorie Prediction for
                Team Jumbo-Visma</i>, supervised by Dr. Christof Seiler. I 
                investigated conformal regression techniques to provide 
                prediction sets, quantifying the reliability of the models 
                predictions. This allows Team Jumbo-Visma to adapt predictions based on 
                the uncertainty of the forecasts. A paper on my bachelor's thesis can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03778">here</a>. </p>
              <p>
              I also worked on developing a Talent Identification Dashboard 
              for the cycling team using performance statistics, race results 
              and rider profiles. We predict relative PCS (Pro Cycling Stats) 
              points for the upcoming two seasons per specialty (ITT, climber, 
              sprinter). The model helps Team Jumbo-Visma identify the best talents 
              at an early age.</p>

            <p><b>Multi-Modal Embeddings for Isolating Cross-Platform Coordinated Information Campaigns on Social Media
            </b> (co-authored with Prof. Dr. Anda Iamnitchi and Dr. Jerry Spanakis): multi-modal approach that identifies the social media messages potentially engaged in a coordinated information campaign across multiple platforms. Our approach incorporates textual content, temporal information and the underlying network of user and messages posted to identify groups of messages with unusual coordination patterns across multiple social media platforms. We apply our approach to content posted on four platforms related to the Syrian Civil Defence organization known as the White Helmets: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. Results show that our approach identifies social media posts that link to news YouTube channels with similar factuality score, which is often an indication of coordinated operations.

            <p><b>Argumentative Explanations for Group Recommender Systems </b> 
              (co-authored with Dr. Francesco Barile and Dr. Tjitze Rienstra): 
              In this work, we propose a novel approach, which makes use of an argumentative framework built using information about the aspects that are connected to the recommended items. Such framework is used to generate recommendations, and related explanations. We provide a proof of concept on how to generate explanations for the group, as well as specific explanations for the group members, which use the information in the argumentative frameworks to enrich the explanations. Furthermore, we propose privacy-preserving versions for the explanations, as well as a graphical approach based on tag clouds.
